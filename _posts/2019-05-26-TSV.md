title: Creating a TSV-file
subtitle: with Regex and Python




---
Instead of finding only the articles of a dispatch, this time we had to split the data up further into: date, type, header text; we then put it out into a TSV-file, meaning that we used tabs as delimiters. I mainly used the code provided on the course-website.

~~~
# [...]
# try to find a unit-type (article, advertisement and such)
                try: # with regex searching for the tag 'type' and saving the group in a variable 'unitType'
                    unitType = re.search(r'type="([^\"]+)"', s).group(1)
                except: #print if there is no type found
                    unitType = "noType"
                    print(s)

# try to find a header and writing "NO HEADER" if none is found, using try/except like above
                try:
                    header = re.search(r'<head>(.*)</head>', s).group(1)
                    header = re.sub("<[^<]+>", "", header)
                except:
                    header = "NO HEADER"
                    print("\nNo header found!\n")
#cleaning the data by getting rid of tags and such using regex:
                text = re.sub("<[^<]+>", "", s) #deleting tags
                text = re.sub(" +\n|\n +", "\n", text) #getting rid of empty lines
                text = re.sub("\n+", ";;; ", text) #switching out the line breaks with three semicolons
# generating a variable for the file name using the variables for the date, unit type and the counter, that has to be a string:
                fName = date+"_"+unitType+"_"+str(c)

# creating a dictionary:
                dict = { #filling the dictionary with keys and values:
                    'id': fName,
                    'date': date,
                    'type': unitType,
                    'header': header,
                    'text': text
                }
# appending the dict to a list:
                dataList.append(dict)

# column names for the tsv:
tsv_columns =  ['id', 'date', 'type', 'header', 'text']

# writing tsv, using the list made with the dictionary, a tab as delimiter and the variable for the field names:
with open(newPath + 'dispatch.tsv', 'w', encoding="utf8") as f:
    writer = csv.DictWriter(f, delimiter ='\t',fieldnames=tsv_columns)
    writer.writeheader()
    for data in dataList:
        writer.writerow(data)
