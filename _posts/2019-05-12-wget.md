Scraping some data of the web with wget, using the Windows terminal and .txt-files containing links, which were extracted and modified with the help of regex.
First we had to take a look at the websites code, copying it into a .txt-file.
Then we searched for the incomplete links (they looked like this: `<a href="text?doc=Perseus%3atext%3a2006.05.0001" class="aResultsHeader">The Daily Dispatch: November 1, 1860., [Electronic resource]</a>`). Using regex we got rid of the unnecessary stuff by coping only the links without code (something like <code>text\?doc.+[^"]</code>).
Next, I modified the links with the help of regex (search for: <code>text?</code>, replace with <code>http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/dltext?</code>).
At last, I could use the links for downloading the articels with the wget-command (wget -i links.txt -P ./folderYouWantToSaveTo/ -nc).
