What had to be done: running the provided code, fixing issues if any occure; try the provided code on the whole dispatch and comparing different topic numbers (30 vs. 40).
What happended: the code ran smoothly, as long as I did not try to make changes to it; running the whole dispatch however repeatedly resultet in a "Memory error". That's why I tried to ran only one year after the other (1860, 1861 and so on). In those instances, the notebook did not show graphs in months (x axis), but for all the days;

**Dispatch 1864 20 topics:**

**Dispatch 1860 30 topics:**

... the code was the same (and the output of the table showed that the column "month" was created and stored the correct data)... So I am not sure what went wrong there...
