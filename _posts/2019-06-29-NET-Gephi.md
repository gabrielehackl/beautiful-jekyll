title: Visualization with Gephi
subtitle: using Geo Layout Plugin




---
What had to be done: visualize a network of places in the “Dispatch”, if places are mentioned in the same article, they must be connected; use the coordinates to work with Geo Layout plugin;
What happended: I first made a visualization with Gephi without the Plugin and a second one with the Plugin; I mainly used the same settings we used in the course for the layout "ForceAtlas2"; because of the nodes being places on the one hand and articles on the other hand, the articles (which do not have coordinates) are grouped together at the bottom of the diagramm, when using the plugin;

##Visualization I:
