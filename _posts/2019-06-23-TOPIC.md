title: Topic Modelling
subtitle: First contact with jupyter

What had to be done: running the provided code and fixing issues that occure; try the provided code on the whole dispatch and run different topic numbers (30 vs. 40).
What happended: the code ran smoothly, as long as I did not try to make changes to it; running the whole dispatch however repeatedly resultet in a "Memory error". That's why I tried to ran only one year (1860). This time, the notebook did not show graphs in months (x axis), but for all days of a month;
To few the most dominant topic I looked at the output of "print(lda_model.get_document_topics(testDoc))" to get the topic-number and used the command "lda_model.print_topic(*number*)" to few its content.

**Dispatch 1864 20 topics:**

The dominant topic was number 6:
~~~
'0.014*"enemy" + 0.012*"general" + 0.009*"gen" + 0.008*"army" + 0.007*"th" + 0.006*"prisoners" + 0.006*"hundred" + 0.006*"cavalry" + 0.005*"river" + 0.005*"wounded"'
~~~

**Dispatch 1864 30 topics:**

The dominant topic was number 4. It is similar to the topic Nr. 6 from the 20-topics-version:
~~~
'0.019*"general" + 0.014*"army" + 0.009*"th" + 0.009*"gen" + 0.007*"rebel" + 0.006*"thousand" + 0.006*"rebels" + 0.005*"york" + 0.005*"grant" + 0.005*"sherman"'
~~~

**Dispatch 1864 40 topics:**

The dominant topic was number 12. It is similar to the topics Nr. 6 and 4 from the other versions, more so to topic Nr. 4 from the 20-topics-version, containing "general", "cavalry", "river" and "enemy":

~~~
'0.017*"general" + 0.016*"gen" + 0.015*"enemy" + 0.014*"th" + 0.012*"army" + 0.007*"corps" + 0.007*"force" + 0.007*"cavalry" + 0.007*"river" + 0.006*"troops"'

**Dispatch 1860 30 topics:**

... the code was the same (and the output of the table showed that the column "month" was created and stored the correct data)... So I am not sure what went wrong there...

![image 1864_30](/img/1860output.jpg)

The dominant topic was number 28:
~~~
'0.016*"states" + 0.014*"south" + 0.014*"state" + 0.010*"mr" + 0.010*"union" + 0.008*"carolina" + 0.006*"southern" + 0.005*"government" + 0.005*"united" + 0.005*"convention"'
